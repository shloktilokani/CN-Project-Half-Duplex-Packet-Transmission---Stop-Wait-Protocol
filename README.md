# CN-Project-Half-Duplex-Packet-Transmission---Stop-Wait-Protocol
Packet Transmission Half Duplex

Our project presents an IoT application harnessing WS2812b individually addressable LEDs. We've crafted a hands-on demonstration vividly depicting the complex journey of packet transmission within a half-duplex network, employing the stop-and-wait protocol. This innovative application serves as a valuable educational tool, providing a visual representation for individuals learning about computer networks. By showcasing how packets traverse a half-duplex network.
